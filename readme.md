# 2BNB Heimdall
Heimdall is a Discord bot that was created to be able to manage services installed on 2BNB's dedicated server "Blyat 1", as well as some minor admin helpers for managing the Discord server itself.

# For Heimdall's Developers
## Install
To install the bot ready for use, a few pieces of software are required.

### Requirements
- NodeJS v10.16.0 and above
- Python 2 (v2.7.15)

Once the above requirements have been installed:

1. Open a terminal of your choice
1. Use `npm install` to install the required dependencies
1. Create/get a copy of `config.json`. If the bot has already been set up with a security token, then get a copy from an Admin. If this is the first time setting Heimdall up, then create a `config.json` file from the `config.json.sample` file
1. Use `nodemon index.js` to start Heimdall. If all was done correctly, you should see `Info: Bot ready...` appear in the terminal and the bot itself show as online in Discord
