# 2BNB Heimdall
Heimdall is a Discord bot that was created to be able to manage serivces installed on 2BNB's dedicated server, as well as some minor admin helpers for managing the Discord server itself.

# For Heimdall's Developers
## Install
To install the bot ready for use, a few pieces of software are required.

### Requirements
- NodeJS v12.6.0 and above
- Python 2 (v2.7.15)

Once the above requirements have been installed:

1. Open a terminal of your choice
1. Use `npm install` to install the required dependencies
1. Use `node index.js` to start Heimdall. If all was done correctly, you should see `Info: Bot ready...` appear in the terminal and the bot itself show as online in Discord
